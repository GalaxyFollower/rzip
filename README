FILES FOR MAKING RZIP MODELS
=============================

The model scripts
-----------------
 rzip.m	                     the basic model creator (currently equal to rzip_v3)
 rzip_v1.m	                 the rzip used for the jt60 work and the original ID work
 rzip_v2.m	                 the improved rzip_v1 leaner and asymmetric.             
 rzip_v3.m	                 the Lagrangian rzip with multiple structure reduction.             

 rzip_full.m                 a set of rzip_v2's which do not truncate the saving procedure.
 rzip_fulle.m                save all eigenmodes.
 rzip_noeig.m                save all circuits.



 plot_machine.m              plot a machine
 plot_machine3d.m            plot a machine with 3d current showing
